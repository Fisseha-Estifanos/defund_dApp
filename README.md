## Introduction

> The refund by location smart contract is aimed to be used when one party, for example, an employer, agrees to pay another party, for example, an employee, for being present in a certain geographic area for a certain duration. The employee‚Äôs phone sends its GPS location to a smart contract at a certain interval. Based on the pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment is executed when all the agreed conditions are met. If at any point, the GPS sensor indicates that an employee is outside the range of the agreed GPS area, the contract state will be updated to indicate that it is out of compliance.

## Objective

> The main objective of this project is to build a decentralized mobile and web application on the Ethereum blockchain network by using smart contracts.
>
> The web application will be used to interact with the employers to make several actions on the smart contract like adding employees and checking the status of individual employees and their locations.
>
> The mobile application will be used from the employee's side to record individual employee locations and interact with the smart contract such that the state of the individual employment agreement is accounted for as per the initial agreement with the employer.

> Therefor, for this refund by location decentralized application, we are going to implement a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain network that can record the locations of employees, manage several agreements between the employer and employees, and update the current status of the contract between the employee and employer based on the initial agreement.
